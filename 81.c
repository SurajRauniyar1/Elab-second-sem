/*
Festember 2021 is coming!
Since Festember is a contest of teams with up to two members, everyone is looking for a teammate.
There are N contestants (numbered 1 through N) who want to participate in Festember, let's denote the skill level of the ith contestant by Si.
These people want to pair up in N/2 teams; each team should consist of two people.
Clearly everyone wishes for their teammate to be as skilled as possible, so everyone wants to maximize their teammate's skill level.
We call a pairing (an unordered N/2-tuple of teams) valid if there are no two teams consisting of people (A,B) and (C,D) such that SD>SB and SA>SC â€“ in that case, A and D would both prefer to be on the same team rather than with their current
teammates.
