You like tracking airplane flights a lot. Specifically, you maintain history of an airplane's flight at
several instants and record them in your notebook. Today, you have recorded N such records h1, h2,
..., hn, denoting the heights of some airplane at several instants. These records mean that airplane
was first flying on height h1, then started changing its height to h2, then from h2 to h3 and so on.
The airplanes are usually on cruise control while descending or ascending, so you can assume that
plane will smoothly increase/ decrease its height from hi to hi + 1 with a constant speed. You can see
that during this period, the airplane will cover all possible heights in the range [min(hi, hi+1), maxſhi,
hi+1)] (both inclusive). It is easy to see that the plane will be at all possible heights in the range exactly
a single instant of time during this ascend/descend.
You are interested in finding the maximum integer K such that the plane was at some height exactly K
times during the flight

The software tool is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with
monitored access. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change,
why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.
Software tools are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the
history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it
was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well
managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled 'first come, first served' system. It can also serve
as a mechanism for due diligence for software projects.
In this problem we'll consider a simplified model of a development project. Let's suppose, that there
are N source files in the project. All the source files are distinct and numbered from 1 to N.
The tool, that is used for maintaining the project, contains two sequences of source files. The first
sequence contains the source files, that are ignored by the tool. If a source file is not in the first
sequence, then it's considered to be unignored. The second sequence contains the source files, that are
tracked by the tool. If a source file is not in the second sequence, then it's considered to be untracked.
A source file can either be or not be in any of these two sequences.

The hero of this story is Johan.
Inspired by the legendary competitive coder Hardik, Johan has also started preparing to race to the
top of the ranks.
Johan is going to practice N different problems in the exact given order over the next M days. For
each problem, he writes down the amount of time 'qi' he will take to think and code the 'ith' problem
(He is quite good at estimating!).
Before starting on the problems, he took advice from experienced competitive programmers on his
practice routine and almost all of them advised him to keep his daily load at the minimum possible
and avoid overtraining.
Since Johan already has N problems to solve, he asks you to find the minimum time I such that
training every day for a time "ti<=1" is sufficient to solve all the N problems in M days.

Mohit has no work to do in the kitchen, so he decided to play a card game with the following rules:
Initially, N cards are placed in a row on a table. Each card is placed either face up or face down.
The goal of the game is to remove all cards from the table, one by one.
A card may be removed only if it is currently facing up.
When a card is removed, its adjacent cards (the cards directly to its left and right, if they exist) are
flipped, i.e. a card that was facing up will be facing down and vice versa.
There is an empty space left behind each removed card, i.e. the remaining cards are not moved to
create a contiguous row of cards again.
Therefore, if the game starts with three cards and the middle card is removed, then the cards on the
sides are flipped, but removing one of these cards afterwards does not cause the other card to be
flipped, since it is only adjacent to the empty space created by removing the middle card.
Determine whether Mohit is able to win this game.
 38
Jeferson was given a string s of length 8 consisting solely of 'O's and 'l's.
Assume that the characters of the string are written in a circular fashion.
Jeferson need to find the number of O-1 or 1-0 transitions that one has to make while making a single
traversal over the string. ie. start from any character and go circularly until you get back to the same
character, and find the number of transitions that you made.
The string is said to be said to be uniform if there are at most two such transitions.
Otherwise, it is called non-uniform.
Given the string s, tell whether the string is uniform or not.

Selvan went to the German for participating in the reality game show.
He wants to qualify as participants among all country students. if he gets cleared the coding part then only he will be eligible for the next level.
He got the questions like, you have to read in an array of integers sequentially and print its elements in reverse order.
Now Selvan wants to identify the logic of the coding part using a pointer and he has to display the correct result then only he can participate in the game show.

Murugan has given a sequence of integers al, a2,...,an to his brother Vinayak. Vinayak needs to paint elements in colors, so that:
If we consider any color, all elements of this color must be divisible by the minimal element of this color.
The number of used colors must be minimized.
For example, it's fine to paint elements [40,10,60] in a single color, because they are all divisible by 10. Vinayak can use any color an arbitrary amount of times (in particular, it is allowed to use color only once). The elements painted in one color do not
need to be consecutive.
For example, if a=[6,2,3,4,12] then two colors are required: let's paint 6, 3, and 12 in the first color (6,3, and 12 are divisible by 3) and paint 2 and 4 in the second color (2 and 4 are divisible by 2). For example, if a=[10,7,15] then 3 colors are
required (we can simply paint each element in a unique color).

Mohan is very particular about numbers. There are 'K' digits that he dislikes: D1, D2,...Dk.
Mohan is shopping, and now paying at the cashier. His total is 'N' yen (the currency of Japan), thus he has to hand at least 'N' yen to the cashier (and possibly receive the change).
However, as mentioned before, he is very particular about numbers. When he hands money to the cashier, the decimal notation of the amount must not contain any digits that he dislikes. Under this condition, he will hand the minimum amount of money.

Simon has a string s of length n . He decides to make the following modification to the string:
Pick an integer k, (1sksn).
For i from 1 to n-k+1 , reverse the substring s[i:i+k-1] of s. For example, if string s is qwer and k=2, below is the series of transformations the string goes through:
qwer (original string)
wqer (after reversing the first substring of length 2)
wear (after reversing the second substring of length 2)
werq (after reversing the last substring of length 2)
Simon wants to choose a k such that the string obtained after the above mentioned modification is lexicographically the smallest possible among all choices of k. Among all such k, he wants to choose the smallest one. Since he is busy attending Felicity
2020, he asks for your help.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:
a is a prefix of b, but a+b;
in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

Recently, Bharani met with Dharani in a philatelic store, and since then they are collecting coins together. Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins. Dharani likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in
such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation.
For arranging coins Bharani uses the following algorithm. One step of his algorithm looks like the following:
He looks through all the coins from left to right;
If he sees that the ith coin is still in circulation, and (i + 1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from (i + 1)th.
Bharani repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure. Bharani calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence, e.g. the number of
times he looks through the coins from the very beginning. For example, for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals one.
Today Dharani invited Bharani and proposed him a game. First he puts n coins in a row, all of them are out of circulation. Then Dharani chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for n times. During this process
Dharani constantly asks Bharani what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence.
The task is more complicated because Bharani should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind. Help Bharani with this task.

Dr. Abdul Kalam is a Professor at a top university. There are n students under Kalam supervision, the programming skill of the ith student is ai.
Kalam has to form k teams for yet another new programming competition. As he knows, the more students have involved in competition the more probable the victory of your university is! So Kalam has to form no more than k (and at least one) non-empty team
so that the total number of students in them is maximized. But Kalam also knows that each team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in each team should differ by no more than 5. Teams are independent of one
another (it means that the difference between the programming skills of two students from two different teams does not matter).
It is possible that some students not be included in any team at all.
Your task is to report the maximum possible total number of students in no more than kk (and at least one) non-empty balanced teams.

Festember 2021 is coming!
Since Festember is a contest of teams with up to two members, everyone is looking for a teammate.
There are N contestants (numbered 1 through N) who want to participate in Festember, let's denote the skill level of the ith contestant by Si.
These people want to pair up in N/2 teams; each team should consist of two people.
Clearly everyone wishes for their teammate to be as skilled as possible, so everyone wants to maximize their teammate's skill level.
We call a pairing (an unordered N/2-tuple of teams) valid if there are no two teams consisting of people (A,B) and (C,D) such that SD>SB and SA>SC – in that case, A and D would both prefer to be on the same team rather than with their current
teammates.

Most of the the popular Universities has the following grading policy:
Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 'O' to '100'.
Any grade less than '40' is a failing grade.
Nathan is a professor at one such university and likes to round each student's 'grade' according to these rules:
If the difference between the 'grade' and the next multiple of '5' is less than '3', round 'grade' up to the next multiple of '5'.
If the value of grade' is less than '38', no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
Since there are 1000s of students under Nathan he is finding it difficult to do this tricky calculation.
Can you help Nathan in the calculation

Dharma has two arrays, 'A' and 'B', both containing 'N' integers.
A pair of indices (i, j) is beautiful if the 'ith' element of array 'A' is equal to the 'ith' element of array 'B'.
In other words, pair (i, j) is beautiful if and only if A[i] = B[j].
A set containing beautiful pairs is called a beautiful set.
A beautiful set is called pairwise disjoint if for every pair ([], [i]) belonging to the set there is no repetition of either I[i] or r[i] values.
For instance, if A= [10,11,12,5,14] and B= [8,9,11,11,5] the beautiful set [(1,2),(1,3),(3,4)] is not pairwise disjoint as there is a repetition of 'l', that is I[0][0] = 1[1][0].
Your task is to change exactly 'l'element in 'B' so that the size of the pairwise disjoint beautiful set is maximum.
It should return an integer that represents the maximum number of pairwise disjoint beautiful pairs that can be formed.
